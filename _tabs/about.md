Welcome. I'm Jakub, and I'm a human[^1]. This is where I write.

I write primarily because it helps me organize my thoughts, and every so often those ideas can be helpful to others. I hope you'll find my posts informative, engaging, and valuable.

These are my personal thoughts and opinions, not those of my employer, my friends, my cat, or you.

My thoughts might change over time as I keep an open mind. This blog is like a snapshot of my ideas at different times. Some older posts might not reflect my current views.

[^1]: My LLM usage policy is as follows: I employ LLM models for image generation, spellchecking and grammar checking, research assistance, searching through my personal highlights of articles and documents, and conversing with my notes. I never use AI to compose the original drafts or generate writing ideas.
